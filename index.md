## What is the Diabetes:M app?
- It's an app that replaces the small black machine for carb counting.
- You need to bonk her sensor first.
- Open the Diabetes:M app on her phone.
- Select 'Bolus Advisor'and enter glucose level, direction if not straight, carb count, any exercise.

## What is a finger pricker?
The finger pricker is used to draw blood from a finger. It contains a drum of 6 lancets and a fresh one should be used each time. You can click through the lancets by flicking the switch backwards and forwards. There is a depth setting at the bottom that should be at 2.5. 

## What are the 2 pens?
There are 2 pens to use, a Red (Novorapid) one which is used for Breakfast, Lunch, and Tea and a Blue/Grey (Lantus) one used for before bed.

## What is the sensor?
The sensor is on the underside of one of Thea's arms and can be bonked with her phone to give a blood sugar level via her interstitial fluid. Get her phone and open the only app on her main page, then hold the bottom half of her phone over the sensor. It will beep twice and give you a level.

## What is the blood sugar machine?
This is the small black machine that we use to get blood sugar readings if we need them although generally we use the sensor and app. It uses a single use strip that the blood goes on to work this out.

## How do I do a finger prick test?
1. Check if there is an available lancet by looking at the top number. If it is on 1 then replace the drum.
2. Flick the switch forward and back so the number changes.
3. Let her pick a finger from pinky to middle on either hand.
4. Put the pointy end over the pad of that finger and depress the button.
5. Milk the finger until there is a big dot of blood.
6. Add a test strip to the machine.
7. Let it startup and say it should match code 111.
8. Put the blood onto the sensor until it reaches the top of the small test area.
9. If it gives an error, start again.
10. If it gives reading add the carbs (if required).

## How do I put the tip on the pen?
This is the same for both pens and a fresh one needs to be used each time.

1. Peel the strip off
2. Screw onto the top of the pen until secure.
3. Unscrew the clear cover (Keep this).
4. pull the small green cap off 
5. Twist the pen setting around by 2 and make sure it squirts out. If it doesn't then try again or repalce the tip.
6. It's now ready to use.

## How do I give an injection?
1. Set the dose on the bottom of the pen.
2. find an injection site. We usually do bum cheek for breakfast and supper, then alternate legs for lunch and tea.
3. Quickly push it all the way in.
4. Depress the button and count to 10.
5. Quickly remove the pen.

## How do I remove the needle?
1. Screw the clear cover back on.
2. Unscrew it again with the needle inside.
3. Put it in the sharp bin

## How do I change the finger prick drum?
1. Gently pull the end off the finger pricker.
2. Pull out the drum.
3. Push the new drum in so the flat edge is pointing out and is flush to the sides.
4. Slide the bottom back on.
5. Make sure the depth setting has not changed.
